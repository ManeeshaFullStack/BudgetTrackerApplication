Budget Tracker Application
Overview

Budget Tracker is a Core Java console application for managing income and expenses. This project demonstrates hands-on programming experience in Core Java, including OOP concepts, collections, streams, and concurrency, giving practical exposure at each stage of development.

Features

Add income and expense transactions with category, amount, and date.

View total income, total expenses, and remaining balance.

List all income or expense transactions separately.

Each transaction has a unique 14-digit ID.

Demonstrates thread-safe operations using ReentrantLock.

Uses Java Streams and Collections for filtering and summing transactions.

Technologies Used

Core Java 17

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Java Collections (ArrayList)

Java Streams API

Concurrency (ReentrantLock)

How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ManeeshaFullStack/BudgetTrackerApplication


Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.).

Run the main class:
TransactionManager.java

Follow the console prompts to add transactions or view reports.

Project Structure
TransactionManager.java  // Handles user interaction and transaction operations
BudgetManager.java       // Maintains the list of transactions

Learning Highlights

Applied OOP concepts: classes, objects, enums, and encapsulation.

Practiced Java Streams for filtering, summing, and displaying transactions.

Implemented basic thread safety with ReentrantLock.

Developed real-world logic for personal finance management.

Strengthened hands-on Core Java programming skills from design to execution.
