# 🧾 Budget Tracker Application

## 📘 Overview
**Budget Tracker** is a **Core Java console application** for managing **income and expenses**.  
This project demonstrates **hands-on programming experience** in Core Java, including **OOP concepts**, **collections**, **streams**, and **concurrency**, giving practical exposure at each stage of development.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add **income** and **expense** transactions with *category, amount, and date*  
- View **total income**, **total expenses**, and **remaining balance**  
- List all **income** or **expense** transactions separately  
- Each transaction has a **unique 14-digit ID**  
- Demonstrates **thread-safe operations** using `ReentrantLock`  
- Uses **Java Streams** and **Collections** for filtering and summing transactions  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Core Java 17**  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
- **Java Collections (`ArrayList`)**  
- **Java Streams API**  
- **Concurrency (`ReentrantLock`)**
